## Unreleased

## [1.0.0] - 2018-12-03

Basic meta-analyzer that takes in the results of our test finder, npm distributed file analyzer, and Markus' callgraph analyzer, and produces a filtered output set. Could also be modified to take in sloccount results (com.returntocorp.sloc-analyzer) and filter!
